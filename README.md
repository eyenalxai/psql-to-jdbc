## Enhanced Authentication

### Better Auth Models Generation

This project uses [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) - a comprehensive authentication library that supports multiple frameworks and providers. One of its key features is the ability to generate type-safe Drizzle ORM models for authentication. To generate the authentication schema:

```bash
yarn auth:generate
```

This command:

- Generates type-safe authentication models
- Outputs the schema to `src/server/database/auth-schema.ts`

Run this command whenever you make changes to your authentication configuration.

## Type-Safe API with tRPC

Leverage [tRPC](https://trpc.io) for end-to-end type-safe APIs without the need for code generation or runtime type checking.
